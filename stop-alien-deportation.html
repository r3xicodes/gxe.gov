          <h2>Main Report</h2>
          <p class="lede">Seravell, Great Holy Xanarcica Empire – The Great Holy Xanarcica Empire has declared itself the foremost defender of alien rights against the rising tide of deportations spreading across the world. With the passage of the Interstellar Protection and Residency Act (IPRA), the Empire has formally guaranteed permanent residency rights for alien communities and outlawed forced removal within the Xana Majesty’s Territories.</p>

          <p>The law was signed yesterday in a solemn ceremony by Her Seraphic Majesty, Empress Elaria II Xana, in the Hall of the Crown at Seravell. Addressing the National Assembly, ministers, and the gathered press, the Empress framed the law as both a moral obligation and a statement of Imperial destiny.</p>

          <blockquote class="pull-quote">“Deportation is fear disguised as policy. This Empire was not built upon exclusion, but upon strength in union. From this day forward, under the Xana Crown, none who dwell within our dominion shall be cast away.” — Her Seraphic Majesty, Empress Elaria II Xana</blockquote>

          <p>The bill passed with commanding majorities across both chambers of the Assembly following weeks of debate. Opposition, mostly from the Border Territory delegation, cited concerns about resource allocation, but their voices were eclipsed by broad support from the Core and the Realms. The Ministry of Finance confirmed that new provisions will increase funding for integration and security programs to meet the expanded obligations of the law.</p>

          <h3>Legislative Details</h3>
          <p>The Interstellar Protection and Residency Act (IPRA) enacts sweeping protections across the Empire:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Permanent Residency Granted:</strong> All aliens legally residing in the Empire as of Optuvem 1st, 226480, are granted permanent residency.</li>
            <li><strong>Ban on Deportation:</strong> Forced removal is outlawed except in the event of severe criminal conviction, subject to Imperial Court review.</li>
            <li><strong>Citizenship Pathway:</strong> A clear, ten-year pathway to full Imperial citizenship is created for alien residents.</li>
            <li><strong>Universal Applicability:</strong> The law extends to the Imperial Core, Majesty’s Territories, colonies, and protectorates.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Imperial legal scholars note that the Act is the most extensive protection statute for aliens in recorded history.</p>

          <h3>Public Reaction</h3>
          <p>The streets of Seravell erupted in celebration as the Empress’s words were broadcast live across the Empire. Crowds of humans and aliens filled the Grand Forum, waving Imperial banners and chanting “One Crown, One People” and “Sanctuary in the Stars.”</p>

          <p>“This is the day I have waited for,” said Ayanth Val, a long-term alien resident from the Thrayen system. “The Empire has not only given us work and safety, but now a place in its future.”</p>

          <p>Student groups, faith leaders, and advocacy organizations praised the measure. “It is a victory for the principle that dignity belongs to all species,” said Lirae Dorn, director of the Interstellar Rights Coalition.</p>

          <h3>Global Fallout</h3>
          <p>The passage of the IPRA immediately drew international attention. States currently enforcing deportation measures condemned Seravell’s decision as “an affront to sovereign policy,” accusing the GHXE of “political theater masked as morality.”</p>

          <p>At the same time, key allies and partner realms expressed admiration. The Kingdom of Asketheria called the Act “a stabilizing precedent for a fractured world,” while several smaller colonial powers indicated they may follow Seravell’s lead.</p>

          <p>Analysts believe the decision may shift global alignments. “The Empire has reframed the deportation crisis into a question of legitimacy,” said Dr. Kael Vyran of the University of Xara. “It is no longer simply about migration—it is about moral leadership.”</p>

          <h3>Official Response</h3>
          <p>Imperial officials were direct in their rebuttals to foreign criticism. “The GHXE legislates for its people and its Crown, not for the preferences of external states,” said High Minister of State Arelis Vonn. “The Empress’s mandate is protection, not expulsion, and that mandate will be honored across every province and colony.”</p>

          <p>Defense officials quietly confirmed that Imperial Security Forces are prepared to enforce the Act across the Majesty’s Territories, though no operational details were released.</p>

          <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
          <p>With the IPRA now in force, the Empire has solidified its image as a sanctuary amidst growing instability beyond its borders. Whether this act becomes a template for others or a flashpoint for conflict, it marks a defining moment in the Empire’s modern history.</p>

          <p class="epigraph">As Empress Elaria II concluded in her address: <em>“The world may fracture under the weight of fear. But here, beneath the light of the Xana Crown, the Empire shall endure as the shield of the many.”</em></p>
