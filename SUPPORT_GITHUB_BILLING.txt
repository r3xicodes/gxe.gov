Subject: Account locked for Actions â€” unexpected billing block

Hello GitHub Support,

Repository: r3xicodes/gxe.gov
GitHub username: r3xicodes
Date/Time (UTC): 2025-09-17

Description:
My repository's GitHub Actions runs fail immediately with the annotation: "The job was not started because your account is locked due to a billing issue." I did not intentionally add a paid plan or expect charges. I verified repository contents are static and don't require billing. I attached a screenshot showing the failed Actions run.

Please investigate and advise why the account/org was locked for billing. If there is a required action on my side (confirm payment method, reduce usage, or dispute a charge), please provide the steps and exact billing notices you used.

Requested outcome:
- Re-enable Actions for my account (or clarify required steps to remove the billing lock).
- If there was suspicious usage or a mistaken flag on my account, please outline what information you need to resolve it.

Thanks,

r3xicodes
